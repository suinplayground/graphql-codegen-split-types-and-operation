# graphql-codegen: How to generate two files types and operations separately

This repo shows an example code of how we generate two file types and operations separately instead of a single monolithic file that contains both types and operations.

## Try this yourself

1. Clone this repository and install dependencies by NPM.
2. Run graphql-codegen: `npx graphql-codegen`
3. [types.ts](./types.ts) and [operations.ts](./operations.ts) are generated.
